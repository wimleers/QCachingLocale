How to use in your Qt application
---------------------------------

1) Add the QCachingLocale.h file to your project, and add it to your .pro
   file.
2) Create a QCachingLocale instance as soon as possible, preferably in the
   main() function. This will automatically install this object as the system
   locale and remove any earlier installed system locales.
   All your QSystemLocale::query() calls will now be cached by QCachingLocale!

However, the idea comes from the very helpful user in the #Qt IRC channel with 
the nickname cbreak (http://the-color-black.net). Thanks again! :)
