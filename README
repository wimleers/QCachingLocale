How to use in your Qt application
---------------------------------

1) Add the QCachingLocale.h file to your project, and add it to your .pro
   file.
2) Create a QCachingLocale instance as soon as possible, preferably in the
   main() function. This will automatically install this object as the system
   locale and remove any earlier installed system locales.
   All your QSystemLocale::query() calls will now be cached by QCachingLocale!

However, the idea comes from the very helpful user in the #Qt IRC channel with 
the nickname cbreak (http://the-color-black.net). Thanks again! :)

Test case
---------
A test case has been provided: https://gist.github.com/708621. Note that this
particular test case may only be reproducible on Mac OS X 10.6.5 (it has been
reproduced with both Qt 4.6 and Qt 4.7.1).
The output will look something like this:
  Without QCachingLocale:
  4839 ms were necessary for parsing the date 1000 times.

  With QCachingLocale:
  23 ms were necessary for parsing the date 1000 times.
